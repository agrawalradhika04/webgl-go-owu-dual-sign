# webgl-go-owu-dual-sign
This project replicates Google’s famous reversible sign by creating a 3D WebGL structure that reads “OWU” when viewed head-on, but transforms to “GO!” when the viewer walks to the right. The viewer can use “Walk Left” and “Walk Right” buttons to shift their viewpoint along the horizontal axis. Custom 3D geometry is built for each letter to achieve this dual-angle illusion.
